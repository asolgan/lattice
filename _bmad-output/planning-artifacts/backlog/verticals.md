# Backlog — App Verticals (Stream 1)

Stream 1 = app-vertical packages + FEs (LoftSpace, Clinic). Advanced by the **Vertical Steward**; demand
filed by the **Vertical PO** (file-only). Index + cross-lane rules: [../backlog.md](../backlog.md).
**Row discipline** (one item = one row; State = token + ref + one-line next; detail lives in the design
doc + git, never narrated in the cell): see [lattice.md → How this board works](lattice.md).

**Scales.** Imp ★/★★/★★★ · Size XS–XL. **State.** 📋 ready · 🏗️ building · 📐 awaiting-Andrew ·
✅ ratified (designed, not built) · 🚧 blocked (`blocked-on:` / Andrew-gated).

## Vertical demand backlog (PO discovery)

Open items only — shipped demand is in the Done log. The PO files (tagged vertical + owner: FE = Sally +
FE Engineer · pkg = Package Designer · platform = component owner + Lattice lane); the Steward + FE
Engineer build. **No-paper-over:** a missing platform *primitive* routes to [lattice.md](lattice.md) and
the row is `🚧 blocked-on:` it (a missing *lens* is package work, built here).

| Item | What it is (PO view) | Vertical | Owner | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LoftSpace — per-landlord RLS view as the rich decision surface (D1.5 landlord cutover) | The protected `/api/landlord/applications` RLS read shows only a scope-count banner; the rich decision view is still the trusted-all-units console (§10.2). Project signals into `landlordLeaseApplicationsRead`, retiring the console. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | M | 🚧 seq Vault Fire 5 (Vault 🎯 build-next in [lattice](lattice.md)) · Rec C shipped ([design](../../implementation-artifacts/loftspace-d1.5-landlord-rls-decision-surface-design.md)) · readiness clone = fallback if Vault stalls |
| LoftSpace — applicant contact (email/phone) captured but never projected to the landlord | `CreateUnclaimedIdentity` stores `.email`/`.phone`, but neither the `/api/identities` picker nor the landlord `unit-applications` disposition surfaces them — a landlord deciding on an applicant has no way to contact them. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | S | 🚧 blocked-on Vault 5b attended reset, same as row above ([plan](../../implementation-artifacts/vault-crypto-shredding-design.md) 5b-iv checkpoint) — lens-side columns already built |

## PO notes (dated — drives rotation)

Compact rotation memory only — PO *findings* are filed as demand rows above + the Done log; the verbose
dated run-logs live in git history. Rotate LoftSpace ↔ Clinic, staggered from the Steward.

- **Rotation to date:** LoftSpace ×9, Clinic ×7 (last: Clinic 7th run 2026-07-03, reused the shared stack, installed Clinic fresh onto it; drove CreateProvider→CreatePatient→CreateAppointment live; filed the patient/provider self-anchor RLS gap).
- **Method:** reuse the already-up shared stack (detect NATS :4222 / app :7788/:7799), drive the real flow via `/api/op` + the lens projections as the product owner, file scored items. Both apps exist + are exercisable live (`:7788` / `:7799`).
- **Live-stack note (2026-07-03):** `lattice.bootstrap.json` was stale vs. the live Core KV (recreated ~5h prior) — staff-wildcard reads read empty though writes worked; run `lattice bootstrap verify` before assuming a product bug.
- **Next:** LoftSpace.
