# Backlog — App Verticals (Stream 1)

Stream 1 = app-vertical packages + FEs (LoftSpace, Clinic). Advanced by the **Vertical Steward**; demand
filed by the **Vertical PO** (file-only). Index + cross-lane rules: [../backlog.md](../backlog.md).
**Row discipline** (one item = one row; State = token + ref + one-line next; detail lives in the design
doc + git, never narrated in the cell): see [lattice.md → How this board works](lattice.md).

**Scales.** Imp ★/★★/★★★ · Size XS–XL. **State.** 📋 ready · 🏗️ building · 📐 awaiting-Andrew ·
✅ ratified (designed, not built) · 🚧 blocked (`blocked-on:` / Andrew-gated).

## Vertical demand backlog (PO discovery)

Open items only — shipped demand is in the Done log. The PO files (tagged vertical + owner: FE = Sally +
FE Engineer · pkg = Package Designer · platform = component owner + Lattice lane); the Steward + FE
Engineer build. **No-paper-over:** a missing platform *primitive* routes to [lattice.md](lattice.md) and
the row is `🚧 blocked-on:` it (a missing *lens* is package work, built here).

| Item | What it is (PO view) | Vertical | Owner | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mixed-use composition surfaces** | The "more than the sum" beats across lenses the one-liner omitted: **front-desk** unified resident context (lease + visit + open tab + booked class in one lookup, surfaced before asked) and **operations** portfolio-pulse aggregate (occupancy + service-attach-rate across packages) — views that exist only because the packages share one graph. Aggregate lenses + FE across both apps + Loupe. | Café/Wellness | FE + pkg | ★★★ | M | 🏗️ building · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/mixed-use-composition-design.md) · next: portfolio-pulse |
| **Care→Wellness referral** | Post-visit, the clinic worklist offers a bookable wellness class (the clinic+wellness emergence — shared scheduling shape); a clinic→wellness handoff that opens a booking from the appointment context. | Clinic/Wellness | pkg + FE | ★ | S | 📋 ready (after Wellness) |
| **Clinic patient picker doesn't scale** | `#provider` still has no search (lower-urgency half, left open). | Clinic | pkg + FE | ★ | XS | 📋 ready |
| **Clinical notes are write-only** | `RecordEncounter` PHI (`ddls.go:333-336`) captured, never projected. The cited `clinicPatientsRead` Secure-Lens precedent does NOT extend — that decrypts identity-anchored Vault ciphertext; this is raw plaintext on a non-identity vertex, and that exact shortcut was already REJECTED pre-Vault (`vault-crypto-shredding-design.md` ratification decision #2). | Clinic | pkg | ★★★ | M | 🚧 blocked-on: Vault extended to non-identity content (architectural fork, Andrew) |
| **Billing is self-pay only, no payer dimension** | `clinic-ledger`'s `DebitAccount`/`CreditAccount` (append-only, lens-derived balance) has no concept of an insurance payer — every charge is implicitly self-pay. Add a bounded `billedTo: self｜insurance` + `expectedReimbursement` dimension to a debit entry (NOT real X12 837/835 claims/clearinghouse integration — that's a certified-EHR-scale undertaking, explicitly out of bounds for a reference vertical) so a clinic can at least track what it billed insurance for vs. collected. | Clinic | pkg | ★★ | M | 📋 ready |
| **No-show doesn't cost anything** | `SetAppointmentStatus(status=noShow)` is purely a status flip — no consequence. `clinic-ledger`'s `DebitAccount` + `clinic-reminders`' Weaver gap-remediation pattern (`missing_reminder` → `directOp`) are both already shipped; a `noShow-no-fee-charged` gap closed the same way (`directOp DebitAccount`) auto-protects revenue on the same mechanism reminders already use. | Clinic | pkg | ★ | S | 📋 ready |
| **Clinic is a single-location, single-specialty silo** | `location-domain` is unused by `clinic-domain` (explicit in its own docs, unlike `loftspace-domain`); a provider has exactly one `specialty` and no site. A real multi-site practice group needs provider↔location + per-location scheduling — mirror `loftspace-domain`'s already-proven `location-domain` integration pattern. Bigger structural lift; sequence after the other Clinic items land. | Clinic | pkg | ★★ | L | 📋 ready |
| **Self-service identity 403s on THIS dev stack — env gap, not a code gap** | Re-grounded 2026-07-10: the filed fix (`ClaimIdentity` right after `CreateUnclaimedIdentity`) was wrong — the real mechanism (`ProvisionConsumerIdentity`) is already built; this stack just needs a one-time ops step + Gateway restart. No FE/package change needed. See [finding](../../implementation-artifacts/self-service-identity-env-gap-finding.md). | Cross-vertical | ops | ★★★ | XS | 🚧 blocked-on: Gateway `identityProvisioner` grant + restart — needs Andrew auth (chip filed) |

**Explicitly descoped (ambitious-PO pass, 2026-07-09):** structured diagnosis/procedure coding (ICD/CPT),
vitals, and e-prescribing were considered and deliberately NOT filed — a certified EHR is out of scope for a
reference vertical whose job is demonstrating platform mechanics, not clinical-coding/DEA compliance. Flagging
the boundary so it reads as a decision, not an oversight.

**Spec** = the go-live composition demo (public-presence site, `localhost:7900/#demo`) — four lenses × package
toggles. PO ruling: all composition is **package-level, no Lattice block** (ledger `heldFor` anchor · generic
`claim_cell` · `contextHint.reads` — precedent: `DebitAccount`→clause; file:line grounding in the commit).
Build against the real key shapes, not the demo's: keys are **NanoIDs** (Contract #1) and the account→lease
relation is `heldFor` (the demo's `ACC88`/`BK7`/`L204` + `billedWith` are cosmetic).

## PO notes (dated — drives rotation)

Compact rotation memory only — PO *findings* are filed as demand rows above + the Done log; the verbose
dated run-logs live in git history. Rotate LoftSpace ↔ Clinic ↔ Café, staggered from the Steward. **Wellness
joins once `cmd/wellness-app` (Inc 2) ships** — today it has a package but no app to exercise; see
[agents/vertical-po/SKILL.md](../../../agents/vertical-po/SKILL.md) §1.

- **Rotation to date:** LoftSpace ×12, Clinic ×10, Café ×1 (2026-07-09: first live exercise — found Weaver tab-settlement posting fails closed on the shared stack (platform bug, blocked-on lattice.md) + no payment-collection UI).
- **Method:** reuse the already-up shared stack (detect NATS :4222 / app :7788/:7799/:7801), drive the real flow via `/api/op` + the lens projections as the product owner, file scored items. All three apps exist + are exercisable live (`:7788` / `:7799` / `:7801`).
- **Live-stack note:** a stale bootstrap JSON vs. a recreated Core KV was a recurring dev-loop trap (2026-07-03, 2026-07-04) that silently emptied reads; `make up` now self-heals it (`109f59a`, 2026-07-05) — re-verify empty-read reports as a real product bug first.
- **2026-07-06:** Enriched Café+Wellness → 4 grounded, sequenced rows (Café first) + verified no platform block; spec = the go-live composition demo.
- **2026-07-09:** LoftSpace — exercised Browse&Apply live; found + root-caused self-service identity never claims (blocks CreateLeaseApplication for every applicant); filed.
- **2026-07-10:** Clinic — drove staff booking/schedule/ledger live on the shared stack; found + confirmed `/api/ledger` unauthenticated (any caller reads any patient's billing history); filed.
- **Next:** Café.
