## Phase 2 implementation status (Stories 9.1–9.3)

What ships today in `internal/weaver` + `cmd/weaver`, and what is deliberately deferred:

| Surface | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Lane 1 (violation-driven)** | ✅ Shipped. One **supervised KV-CDC durable per target** on the `KV_weaver-targets` backing stream (`$KV.weaver-targets.<targetId>.>`, `DeliverLastPerSubject`) via `substrate.ConsumerSupervisor` — never a raw `kv.Watch`. Desired-vs-running reconcile over the `meta.weaverTarget` registry: removal deletes the JetStream durable; a spec change Resets it. |
| **Target registry** | ✅ Shipped. `meta.weaverTarget` CDC source (Core KV `vtx.meta.>`), §10.8 install-time validations (`missing_*` gaps keys, `targetId` uniqueness + dot-free), reject-and-alert (Health KV issue), never silent. |
| **Dispatch OCC (§10.3)** | ✅ Shipped in the full frozen shape: the `weaver-state` mark (`<targetId>.<entityId>.<gapColumn>`) is a **CAS-create** carrying `claimedAt`/`leaseExpiresAt`/`heldBy` and a **NATS per-key TTL at 2× the lease** (the backstop — a dead reconciler can never wedge a gap forever); mark-clearing is **level-reconciled on each watch update AND each reconciler sweep**. `claimId` is shape-only until Epic 10's nudge mints it **atomically with the CAS-create** — an empty `claimId` on a nudge mark is corrupt: the reconciler alerts and **never mints a fresh id** (a fresh id would mean a second `idempotencyKey` → a duplicate external call). |
| **Reconciler sweep** | ✅ Shipped (`internal/weaver/reconciler.go`): an interval-cadence pass (default 1m, clamped ≤ the lease so expiry is always observed before the TTL backstop; lease default 30m, both `Config`-tunable) over every mark — prompt level-clearing of closed gaps, orphan reclaim (target removed, column dropped from row + playbook), corrupt-mark delete+alert (the issue retires once the key stays gone), and **expired-lease reclaim as a fresh episode**: a revision-conditioned **in-place replace** of the mark (fresh lease, re-armed TTL → new revision → new `requestId`), so the key is never absent across a reclaim and only **violating** rows re-dispatch (mirroring lane-1's L1 gate). Re-fire idempotency follows §10.3 by action: `nudge` is safe via `claimId` (Epic 10); a re-fired `triggerLoom`/`assignTask` is the **documented rare-double** — operator-visible via the sweep's Warn logs and heartbeat counters, with the check-before-act probe deferred to Phase 3. All sweep deletes are revision-conditioned; both orphan legs are gated for a warm-up window after start (`SweepOrphanWarmup`, default 5m — a registry-replay-readiness proxy). |
| **Actuator** | ✅ Shipped as **fire-and-forget publish** to `ops.<lane>` with a deterministic per-dispatch-episode `requestId` (derived from the mark's current revision — its CAS-create, or the sweep's reclaim replace; Contract #4 collapses re-fires). **No request-reply, no command outbox** — Weaver has no cursor advance to dual-write; recovery is the mark + level-reconcile + lease: a rejected/lost op leaves the mark in place and the sweep re-attempts it at lease expiry. The op payload carries the row's `expectedRevision` (the OCC revision-condition); `triggerLoom` resolves the live `meta.loomPattern` vertex for `authContext.target` (pattern-as-target). |
| **Actions** | `triggerLoom` (→ `StartLoomPattern` op, never a Go call), `assignTask` (→ `CreateTask` with episode-deterministic `taskId`), `directOp` ✅. **`nudge` is a loud stub** (logged + Health KV issue) until Epic 10 builds the Two-Phase Nudge + `internal/weaver/nudge/`. |
| **Health** | ✅ Contract #5 heartbeat at `health.weaver.<instance>` (metrics: `consumers`, `targets`, `marksInFlight`, `sweepReclaims`, `sweepOrphansDeleted`, `sweepCorrupt`, `sweepLastRunAt`, `timersScheduled`, `timersFired`) + per-consumer pause-state docs at `health.weaver.<instance>.consumer.<name>`; config/data errors surface as issues. |
| **Lane 3 (temporal)** | ✅ Shipped (Contract #10 §10.4). One **fixed supervised durable** `weaver-temporal` on `core-schedules` filtered `schedule.weaver.timer.fired.>`; the lane-1 row handler's **scheduling leg** re-arms `@at(freshUntil)` per delivery (level-driven, replace-on-reschedule); the fired→op conversion submits `MarkExpired` under the **deterministic timer `requestId`** (schedule subject + fire instant) with **no weaver-state mark**. See "Temporal lane" below for the convention column and the accepted Phase 2 bounds. |
| **Control API/CLI (Pause/Resume surface)** | ⏳ Story 9.4 (the supervisor's `Pause`/`Resume` exist; no operator surface yet). |
| **Lane 2 (event-targeted-audit) + `weaver-work`** | ⏳ Phase 3 (§10.3: no durable bucket in Phase 2). |
| **Real target Lens via Refractor + playbook package data** | ⏳ Epic 11 (`lease-signing`); 9.1 exercises the engine with test-written §10.2 fixture rows. |

The engine ships **zero domain knowledge** — targets and playbooks are package data; domain
literals appear only in tests/fixtures.

## Overview

Weaver is the **convergence engine** — it drives the graph toward declared **target states** by
detecting discrepancies and remediating them, optionally by triggering Loom utilities. It is
the declarative counterpart to Loom (brainstorming #122): **Weaver decides *what* is missing;
Loom executes a *fixed procedure* to fill a gap.** A "Lease Application complete" is a *target
state*, not a workflow.

Crucially, **a Weaver target is a Lens** — Weaver is a **consumer of the Refractor**, never its
own cypher runtime. The Refractor projects "currently-violating" rows; Weaver reacts.

Weaver is an **internal service actor** at root-equivalent capability. It **submits operations
through the Processor** (never writes Core KV directly). Its direct writes are to the
`weaver-state` bucket (dispatch/bookkeeping marks, Contract #10 §10.3) and the `weaver-claims`
bucket (Two-Phase Nudge claims, Epic 10).

---

## Pipeline

```
Sensorium (3-lane work stream weaver.work.>)
   → Evaluator (L1 re-confirm + in-flight dedup; L2 hydrate + classify gap + select playbook)
   → Strategist (playbook registry: gap-type → action)
   → Actuator (OCC ops via Processor; trigger Loom via op; external via Two-Phase Nudge)
```

### The 3 lanes (`weaver.work.>`)

Each lane exists because the others structurally cannot see its violations:

| Lane | Trigger | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Violation-driven** | a row in a target Lens's output (CDC over the target KV) | the main path; Refractor keeps the target live |
| **2. Event-driven (targeted-audit)** | a `core-events` event → re-evaluate only the touched subgraph | for targets too costly to keep continuously projected — **built but unexercised in the Phase 2 demo** |
| **3. Temporal** | a fired `@at` schedule on `core-schedules` (`schedule.weaver.timer.fired.>`, ADR-51 / §10.4) | time-derived violations emit no CDC (e.g. "bgcheck older than 90d") — **shipped (Story 9.3)** |

### Evaluator tiers

| Tier | Job | Phase 2 |
|------|-----|---------|
| **L1** | re-confirm row is still violating; drop if already in-flight (`weaver.state.>`) | ✅ |
| **L2** | hydrate context, classify the specific gap, select playbook input | ✅ |
| **L3** | AI-assisted reasoning for ambiguous/novel discrepancies | **deferred → Phase 3** |

### Strategist — playbook registry (package data)

A **playbook** maps gap-type → action. Engine is a generic dispatcher; playbooks ship in the
package (`lease-signing`):

| Gap (example) | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `missing_onboarding` | submit `StartOnboarding` op → **triggers Loom** (op-based, D3) |
| `missing_bgcheck` | **Two-Phase Nudge** → background-check adapter |
| `missing_payment` | Two-Phase Nudge (Stripe) or trigger a Loom collect-payment flow |
| `missing_signature` | assign a sign **task** (direct op) |

### Actuator

- **OCC** — every op carries a revision-condition (substrate per-key revisions) so
  two ticks can't double-apply.
- **Triggers Loom via an op** — auditable, idempotent ledger entry (not a Go call; engines share
  only `substrate/*`).
- **External actions** — Two-Phase Nudge (below).

---

## Targets as Lenses (D4)

Targets project **one row per *candidate* entity with a `violating` boolean** (+ gap columns +
authz-anchor), **not** row-only-when-violating — a gap closing flips the flag via a normal
**upsert** (already supported); only true entity deletion deletes a row (`IsDeleted`, already
handled). This **avoids forcing Refractor retraction work** in Phase 2.

```
weaver-targets.<target>.>   (NATS-KV bucket, existing nats_kv adapter)
  row: { entity_key, applicant_id, violating, missing_onboarding, missing_bgcheck,
         missing_payment, missing_signature, <authz-anchor> }
```

Weaver **watches** the bucket (lane 1). A satisfied entity has `violating=false`; the row
vanishes only on true deletion. (True "emit-only-when-violating" + Refractor
negative/filter-retraction projection is a **deferred** scale-time capability.)

The freshness rule lives **in the target cypher**: `missing_bgcheck = NOT EXISTS(check WHERE
date > now − window)`.

---

## Temporal lane — NATS scheduled messages (ADR-51, Contract #10 §10.4)

Time-derived violations emit no CDC, so Weaver converts **time into an op** using NATS native
message scheduling on the platform-wide **`core-schedules`** stream (`AllowMsgSchedules: true`,
subject root `schedule.>`, provisioned at bootstrap — not Weaver-owned):

```
Lens projects the deadline: row column freshUntil = resolve + window (RFC3339)
  → on each row delivery the Actuator publishes @at(freshUntil) on core-schedules,
       subject  schedule.weaver.timer.<targetId>.<entityId>
       header   Nats-Schedule-Target: schedule.weaver.timer.fired.<targetId>.<entityId>
  ... NATS holds it (durable across restart; re-publish to the same subject replaces) ...
  → at expiry the scheduler republishes the payload BACK INTO core-schedules at the fired subject
  → the weaver-temporal durable (filtered schedule.weaver.timer.fired.>) converts it to a
       MarkExpired op via the Processor (deterministic requestId: schedule subject + fire instant)
  → CDC + outbox event → target Lens re-projects → the freshness gap flips violating → lane-1 remediates
```

- **The freshness window lives in the target cypher, never the engine**: the Lens computes
  `resolve + window` and projects it as the engine-recognized **optional row column `freshUntil`**
  (RFC3339 string; a §10.2 free-form param column by carriage). The engine converts time→op only —
  a non-string/unparseable `freshUntil`, or one without an `entityKey`, surfaces a `RowDataError`
  Health issue and skips scheduling; a **past** `freshUntil` never schedules (any previously-armed
  firing is already durable in the stream; a Lens that only projects past deadlines is a package
  bug that surfaces as "violation never flips").
- **Level-driven scheduling, no edge detection**: every row delivery carrying a future
  `freshUntil` re-publishes the schedule — idempotent under one-schedule-per-subject replace —
  so re-doing the entity before expiry **replaces** the prior timer, and restart replay re-arms
  for free. A schedule-publish failure Naks the row on the bounded delay cadence.
- **Per-target-per-entity timer slot**: the subject carries both dot-free tokens
  (`schedule.weaver.timer.<targetId>.<entityId>`), so two targets watching the same entity hold
  independent timers. The `fired` token is reserved in this subject space — a targetId literally
  named `fired` is refused at scheduling time with a loud Health issue.
- **No weaver-state mark, no lease, for the fired→op conversion** — the §10.4 deterministic
  `requestId` is the dedup: a redelivered firing collapses on the Contract #4
  `vtx.op.<requestId>` tracker; a re-armed timer's new fire instant is a genuinely new op.
  Marks/OCC remain lane-1 remediation-dispatch machinery.
- **Never injected into `core-events` directly** — the transactional outbox stays the sole event
  producer; the fired message becomes a normal **op** (`MarkExpired`, payload
  `{entityKey, targetId, expiredAt}`, submitted under Weaver's service-actor authority with no
  `authContext`; the op's DDL/grants are package data, Epic 11).
- **Accepted Phase 2 bounds** (operator-visible, self-healing):
  - A `MarkExpired` **rejected at the Processor** is not re-attempted by Weaver (fire-and-forget,
    nothing leases it) — the freshness flip then waits for the next CDC touch of the entity. An
    op-*publish* failure IS retried (Nak → the same requestId).
  - With `MaxMsgsPerSubject: 1` on `core-schedules`, a **newer firing at the same fired subject
    rolls up an older one** the consumer has not yet processed — only the latest conversion is
    delivered, which is level-correct (the newest `expiredAt` supersedes; both would poke the
    same entity).
  - **No cancel/purge**: a deleted entity or removed target leaves a pending timer armed; the
    stray fire produces one `MarkExpired` for an absent entity — rejected/no-op at the
    Processor, harmless (no mark, no retry).
- The **fixed `weaver-temporal` durable**'s ack floor is the missed-while-down recovery: fired
  messages persist under limits retention and the durable resumes from its floor on restart.
  Phase 2 is single-instance; multi-instance fan-out is a Phase 3 concern. Heartbeat metrics
  `timersScheduled` / `timersFired` count the lane's two legs since start. No custom scheduler
  subsystem; the op-vertex pruner (#47/#49) remains Phase 2+ maturity.

## Two-Phase Nudge (external idempotency, FR58 — PRD-Alignment Item 3)

External adapter framework lives in `internal/weaver/nudge/`. The **framework is engine**; a
**reference adapter** (`FakeStripe`, `FakeBackgroundCheck`) proves it (demo uses mocked
adapters — the External Adapter framework is proven by a reference adapter; real Stripe is
Phase 3).

```
1. Claim   → write weaver.claims.<claim-id> (direct KV; intent recorded BEFORE the call)
2. Execute → call the external (mocked) adapter; claim prevents any other instance re-initiating
3. Resolve → submit a normal op via Processor recording the result, carrying claim-id reference
```

Claims retained (default 90d) in `weaver.claims.>`; audit joins Core KV (business outcome) to
the claim (operational intent).

## What this component will own

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `internal/weaver/` | Engine: Sensorium, 3-lane work stream, Evaluator tiers, Strategist dispatcher, Actuator |
| `internal/weaver/nudge/` | External Adapter framework + Two-Phase Nudge |
| `cmd/weaver/` | Binary entry point (extractable; shares only `substrate/*`) |

**Package data:** target Lens cypher, playbook definitions, gap→action mappings, mocked-adapter
config (`lease-signing`).

---

## In / Out contracts

| Direction | Contract | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| In | `weaver-targets` `<targetId>.>` KV-CDC durable | lane 1 (primary input — **not** the core-events consumer) |
| In | `events.<domain>.>` per-domain consumer | lane 2 targeted-audit only (Phase 3) |
| In | `schedule.weaver.timer.fired.>` on `core-schedules` | lane 3 (ADR-51 scheduled messages; fixed durable `weaver-temporal`) |
| Out | ops via `core-operations` (`ops.<lane>`) | fire-and-forget; OCC `expectedRevision` payload; trigger-Loom; resolve mutations carry `claim-id` |
| Out | `@at` schedules via `core-schedules` (`schedule.weaver.timer.<targetId>.<entityId>`) | lane 3 scheduling leg; replace-on-reschedule (one schedule per subject) |
| Out (own) | `weaver-state` bucket | in-flight convergence marks (anti-storm); per-key TTL backstop (2× lease) + reconciler sweep |
| Out (own) | `weaver-claims` bucket | Two-Phase Nudge claims (90d retention, Epic 10) |

---

## Failure modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Re-trigger storm | violation persists until gap closes *and* re-projects → `weaver.state.>` in-flight mark suppresses re-trigger |
| **Actuator crash mid-flight** | in-flight marks carry a **TTL/lease**; the reconciler sweep reclaims expired leases so a target is never wedged. *(Tested: `TestWeaverE2E_MidFlightKill` kills the episode between CAS-create and publish and proves the re-attempt.)* |
| External call retried/failed | Two-Phase Nudge claim prevents double-charge; resolve is idempotent |
| Target too costly to keep live | lane-2 on-demand evaluation (deferred-exercise) |

---

## Principles that apply

- **P2** — Processor is the sole Core KV writer; Weaver is a client. Claims/state are
  operational KV, not Core KV (P1).
- **P4** — Weaver enforces declarative convergence invariants; Starlark enforces single-op
  invariants only.
- **Weaver targets ARE Lenses** — Weaver consumes the Refractor; it is not a cypher runtime.
- **Module boundary** — `weaver` imports only `substrate/*`; triggers Loom via NATS/op.

## Deferred (Phase 2+)

- Refractor negative/filter-retraction projection (true emit-only-when-violating).
- Lane-2 on-demand evaluation (built, unexercised in demo).
- L3 evaluator (AI-assisted).
- Full temporal scheduler / op-vertex pruner (#47/#49).
- Real external adapters (Stripe/background-check) — Phase 3 integration.
